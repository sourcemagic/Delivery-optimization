    "#### Quick overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard method to solve an integer programming is called \"Branch and Bound\". \n",
    "\n",
    "Because an integer programming model is harder to optimize than a linear programming model, there will be used a linear programming optimization as help.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Bound**  \n",
    "The linear model can optimize the objective function with continues numbers, so its max value will always be greater than in a integer programming model.  \n",
    "This can be seen as the upper bound.  \n",
    "A lower bound exists also to set the required minimum for solutions. By example at start to 0 for all variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Branch**  \n",
    "While computing combinations to reach the upper bound, there will be some found that fulfill the constraints.  \n",
    "With this solutions the branching will repeatally correct the upper and lower bound to let their distance get smaller and smaller.  \n",
    "The upper bound will decrease, because it is to high for the integer programming.  \n",
    "The lower bound will increase with each best minimum solution found, so that all solutions with lower value can be removed.  \n",
    "&nbsp;\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different solvers available for problems like that, which could process this for us.  \n",
    "In this notebook we use PulP and let it choose the right one. "
